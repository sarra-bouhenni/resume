## Experience

January 2018 -- present
:  **PhD Candidate** -- CERIST Research Center (Algiers) and LIRIS CNRS (Lyon)

   I work in my PhD on the problem of Graph Pattern Matching (GPM) in the context of large-scale distributed graphs. Our goal is proposing new parallel and distributed algorithms to answer GPM queries in big graphs while taking into consideration the shortcomings of prior work in this field. 

June 2019 and January 2021
:  **Graduate Teaching Assistant** -- CERIST Research Center (Algiers)

   I teach the course *Programming languages for Big Data - Scala* in the specialized post-graduation training (PGS). I am in charge of preparing the course materials and practical sessions in addition to exam preparation. The course covers:

   * Basic syntax of Scala programming language.
   * Object Oriented Programming in Scala.
   * Functional programming with Scala, including higher order functions, lambda expressions, partial evaluation, etc.
   * Collections in Scala, Lists, Vectors, Sets and Maps.

August 2017 - December 2017
:  **Data Science Consultant** -- Ya Technologies (Algiers)

   Worked on improving the logging system of the VTC application Yassir. My responsitibilies included mainly: 
   * Extracting log events available at a Kafka server using a logger implemented within NodeJs. 
   * The logger is responsible of transforming the events and sending them to an Elasticsearch server.
   * I have also worked on different visualizations and reporting of the data available on Elasticsearch using Kibana.
   * I was also responsible on deploying and managing the Elasticsearch distributed system on Kubernetes.

September 2016 to June 2017
:  **Data Science and Web Development Intern** -- AITECH (Algiers)

   In my final year's engineering project, I worked on the design and development of a monitoring system for predicting plant diseases in Algeria, using Incremental Machine  Learning algorithms. My responsibilities in this project included: 
   * Collecting data on plant disease prediction for the two diseases: Fusarium Head Blight and Potato Mildiew.
   * Designing a new algorithm for predicting the two diseases with incremental learning based on the new observations.
   * Implementing a backend of disease prediction based on current weather conditions, using Python and Django.
   * Implementing a web application for monitoring and visualization of disease spread in Algerian crop fields, using Angular. 

September 2015 - October 2015
:  **Web Development Intern** -- Carthena Tech (Algiers)

   In this internship, I worked on the development of an e-learning platform for teaching matchematics to high school students of Algeria. My responsibilities included:
   * The design and developement of the platform ui on top of Jomla.
   * Preparation and integration of the different math quizzes to the platform.

## Technical Experience

Programming Languages

:   **Scala:** I have an experience of 3 years working with Scala on top of Spark Apache.

:   **Python:** I Worked with Python and Django for one year during my final year engineering project. 

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **C++**, **Java**

Big data plateforms

:   **Spark Apache** I have an experience of 3 years working with Spark and its GraphX for designing graph pattern matching algorithms in the context of massive graphs (durig the preparation of my PhD). I am also responsible of the big data plateform at the CERIST research center.

:   **Elastic Stack** I have worked with the different components of the Elastic stack including Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana during 6 months as a data science consultant. 

## Spoken languages

* Arabic (native speaker)
* French
